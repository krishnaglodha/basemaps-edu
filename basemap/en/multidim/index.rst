SpatioTemporal Data Handling With GeoServer
===========================================

This training section has the objective to introduce the attendees to using **GeoServer** to ingest and serve raster and vector multidimensional data.
It is worth mentioning that since we are going to focus on advanced topics related to multidimensional data we are going to assume that the user is familiar with GeoServer key concepts/terms such as Coverage, Coverage Store, Style and Layer.

The table of contents for this section is shown here below.
