OGC API - Tiles
================

OGC API - Tiles draft specification describes an API building block that can enable other OGC API implementations to serve maps or tiled feature data divided into individual tiles.

This API is replacing `Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) <https://www.ogc.org/standards/wmts>`_.

GeoServer has a basic implementation of the current `draft spec <https://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-057.html>`_ which is still in evolution.
