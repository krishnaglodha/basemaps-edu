OGC API - Coverages
===================

OGC API - Coverages specifies the fundamental API building blocks for interacting with coverages, like getting metadata information, domain, band structure, and extracting data.

This API is replacing `Web Coverage Service (WCS) <https://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs>`_.
GeoServer has a small, incomplete implementation of the current `draft spec <https://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/19-087.html>`_. The draft itself is still evolving and might change in backwards incompatible ways in the future.
