Creating a custom export configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have gone through all the steps required to create a GeoServer App-Schema configuration and finally uploaded it to a live GeoServer instance. But what if we wanted to make a slight change in the alignment, and publish it again? We would have to go through all the dialogs in the export alignment wizard a second time, probably entering the same information.

This is where custom export configurations come handy. A custom export configuration allows to save in the project file all the settings entered in the export wizard; then, to perform another export applying the saved settings, all one needs to do is to select the name of the custom configuration in the :ref:`export format dialog <appschema_export_format>`.

.. note::
   Please bear in mind that custom export configurations, albeit convenient, have some drawbacks.
   
   * First of all, when a configuration is created, credentials are written to the project file in plain text, which may be undesirable if the project is shared with other people.
   
   * Second, currently the HALE UI offers no options to update or delete an existent custom configuration, so the only possibility to remove a wrong or outdated configuration is to manually edit the project file.
   
   * For these reasons, this feature was left out of the `HALE 2.9.4 <http://blog.dhpanel.eu/2015/11/02/geoserver-app-schema-integration-hale-2-9-4-is-out/>`_ release, the first official release incorporating the GeoServer App-Schema plug-in. The functionality will be re-engineered and introduced in a future realease.

Let's see this feature in action:

#. From the top menu bar, select **File** |rarr| **Export** |rarr| **Create custom alignment export...**
#. The *Export format* dialog we have :ref:`already seen <appschema_export_format>` will open; select, for example, **App Schema Configuration [Direct Upload]**
#. A new dialog will open, where we are asked to give a name and a description to the custom configuration we're about to create:

   .. figure:: ../common/img/hale_custom_export_conf.png
      :align: center
	      
#. Enter name and description and press the **Next** button. You will now be asked to go through all the dialogs in the regular export wizard: follow the above instructions and fill in the required information.
#. As the wizard terminates, a popup will appear to confirm that a new custom configuration has been created in the project:

   .. figure:: ../common/img/hale_custom_export_conf_created.png
      :align: center

#. From now on, the *Export format* dialog will show the custom configuration among the available format options:

   .. figure:: ../common/img/hale_export_format_custom.png
      :align: center

#. Select the *Custom configuration: Upload to local GeoServer* option and hit **Next**
#. The :ref:`Export destination <rest_url>` dialog will open, to allow the user to choose a different target on each export.
#. Press the **Finish** button and the upload will start immediately: no further configuration is necessary!
