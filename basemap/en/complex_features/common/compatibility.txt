Enabling the GeoServer compatibility mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before starting to define the mapping, it is wise to enable the GeoServer compatibility mode, by selecting **Transformation** |rarr| **Compatibility mode** |rarr| **GeoServer** from the menu. You should now see the word *Geo* next to a green tick mark icon at the corner of the status bar on the bottom:

.. figure:: ../common/img/hale_compatibility.png
   :align: center

   *GeoServer compatibility mode is on, no incompatibility detected*

As long as the compatibility mode is enabled, HALE will notify the user if the mapping cannot be translated to an app-schema configuration (as shown in the figure below), due, for example, to the use of an unsupported transformation function.

.. figure:: ../common/img/hale_incompatibility.png
   :align: center

   *GeoServer compatibility mode is on, incompatibility was detected*
