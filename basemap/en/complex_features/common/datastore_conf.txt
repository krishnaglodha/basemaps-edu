Configuring the DataStore
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

On this wizard page, you must enter the `DataStore configuration <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/data-stores.html#app-schema-data-stores>`_ parameters.

.. note:: Although the GeoServer App-Schema extension supports a variety of data store types and multiple data store configurations, the HALE App-Schema plugin only allows to configure a single PostGIS data store. This limitation will likely be removed (or at least alleviated) in future releases of the plugin.

Select the database type, on this case *Relational Database*:

  |datastore_select_type|

Fill the database connection fields:

  |datastore_conf|

The database password is **hale_tutorial**. Be sure to check **Expose primary keys**, or you will get errors where primary key columns are used in attribute mappings.

Clicking on the **Next** button will take you to the last page in the wizard.
