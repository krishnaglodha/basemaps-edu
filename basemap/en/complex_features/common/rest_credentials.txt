Providing REST credentials
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The last wizard page asks you to enter the credentials to access GeoServer's REST services (see figure below).

Username and password for the local GeoServer instance are respectively **admin** and **Geos**. 

Click on the **Finish** button to generate the configuration and upload it to the local GeoServer instance.

.. note:: Before starting the upload, make sure GeoServer is actually running by visiting the URL http://localhost:8083/geoserver. If it's not running start it by double clicking on the **start_geoserver.bat** batch script.

If all goes well, when the upload is finished you should see in the *Report List* view an *App Schema REST export* message with a green tick mark icon on its left side.
