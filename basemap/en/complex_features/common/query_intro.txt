Querying the data via WFS
-------------------------

In this section, you will execute a few WFS queries against the layers you just published and inspect the results.

All the examples are run with `cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`_, a command-line utility to transfer data over the net using a variety of protocols, most notably HTTP. A cURL executable has been included in the training distribution, so all you have to do to try the examples is:

* Run cURL

  * On the ``Windows`` training click on the **curl_shell.bat** batch script in the training root folder: a new terminal window will open, with environment variables properly setup
  * On the ``Linux`` training open the terminal and type ``cd /home/geosolutions/Desktop/geoserver_training`` from this location you can run the cURL commands reported below

* Copy-paste the cURL command from the example text to the terminal window and hit *Enter*
* The response is saved to an **output.xml** file in the training root folder: its content can be more comfortably viewed using Intenet Explorer, or another browser (for proper XML formatting)
