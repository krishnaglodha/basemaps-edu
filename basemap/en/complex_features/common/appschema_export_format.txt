Choosing an export format
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _appschema_export_format:

The first step consists in choosing the export format. The wizard screen should look like this:

.. figure:: ../common/img/hale_align_export_format.png
   :align: center

   *Export format dialog*
   
The highlighted options in the figure above represent two complementary export approaches:

* **App-Schema Configuration**: the configuration is saved to one or more files, which must be manually copied / extracted to the right place in the GeoServer data directory. This approach may be preferred during testing, or when a live GeoServer instance is not available or not accessible.
* **App-Schema Configuration [Direct Upload]**: the configuration is generated and immediately uploaded to GeoServer via its REST API. This approach is more convenient and should generally be preferred.

In the context of this tutorial, we will always do direct uploads, so select the second option (**App-Schema Configuration [Direct Upload]**) in the list and click on the **Next** button. Another dialog will appear, asking for the URL of the GeoServer instance we want to publish to:

.. _rest_url:

.. figure:: ../common/img/hale_geoserver_url.png
   :align: center

Enter http://localhost:8083/geoserver in the *Target URL* field and hit **Next**.
