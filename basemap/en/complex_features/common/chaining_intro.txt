If the alignment defines at least one *Join* relation, the wizard will now ask us to configure `feature chaining <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/feature-chaining.html>`_. Basically, we will provide here the missing configuration bits, that could not be specified in the *Join* definition and that are actually needed by GeoServer to properly nest the joined types. Even if the Join involved more than two types, feature chaining is always configured pair-wise.
